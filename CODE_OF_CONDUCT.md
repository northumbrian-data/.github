## Our Standards

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

gliff.ai understands that, in upsetting or distressing circumstances, and in certain forms or stages of ill health, people may act out of character and may become persistent, angry or upset. However, where it leads to aggressive behaviour or unreasonable demands, it is considered unacceptable. Similarly, behaviour which disrupts normal gliff.ai activities, intentionally or not, is considered unacceptable. gliff.ai considers that all forms of harassment constitute unacceptable behaviour.

We have put together some examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive and welcoming environment, these include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language;
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences and skill/ability levels;
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
- Focusing on what is best for the community and users;
- Showing empathy and respect towards other community members.

We have also put together some examples of unacceptable behavior, these include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances;
- Comments that reinforce social structures of domination and/or discrimination realted to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, ability, physical appear, race and ethnicity, religion and believe or other ireelevant distinctions;
- Trolling, spamming, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
- Public or private harassment, intimidation, stalking, bullying or threating behaviour and lanuague (as well as actualy threats);
- Publishing (or the threat of publishing) others' private and personally identifying information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission ("doxing");
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

The manner of which will depend on the nature and extent of the behavior.

Ultimately, the gliff.ai team have the right to act quickly, before a full investigation of a report, to minimise the  negative effects. As well as the responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

The [gliff.ai Code of Conduct](https://github.com/gliff-ai/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) ‚ö†Ô∏è does not replace existing legal mechanisms, as such, for any incident where a crime may have been committed we will support the victim and pass on the report with necessary details to the police.
