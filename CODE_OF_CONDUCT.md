We have put together some examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive and welcoming environment, these include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language;
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints, experiences and skill levels;
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism;
- Focusing on what is best for the community and users;
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

We have also put together some examples of unacceptable behavior by contributors, these include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances;
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks;
- Public or private harassment;
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission;
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Responsibilites

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

The gliff.ai team aims to ensure our digital space to be a positive and welcoming environment for all contributors so that we can work on what matters most!

As such, the gliff.ai team has the responsibility for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior (examples above) and will take any appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior from contributors.

Ultimately, the gliff.ai team have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. 

## Enforcement

If you come across any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior you should report it by contacting the gliff.ai team at at [community@gliff.ai](mailto:community@gliff.ai?subject=[GitHub%20-%20Conduct]) or on GitHub. Any complaints will be reviewed and investigated as part of our pledge to protect our positive and welcoming environment. As such, we will always maintain confidentiality with regards to the reporter of an incident. Any response given will be considered necessary and appropriate to the report raised to the team.

Any gliff.ai team members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions. This will be judged and a response will be determined by other members of the gliff.ai team leadership.
