## Report a Vulnerability

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any gliff.ai repository please report it to us as an issue using the ‘“security vulnerabilities’ template which will automatically assign the "vulnerability" label. Please do this within the appropriate repository.

Please fill out the “security vulnerabilities’ template to the best of your ability with as much detail as possible to help the gliff.ai team better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue and correct the vulnerability ASAP!

The report should include a description of the vulnerability covering type of issue, location of affected source code, full paths of source file(s), steps to reproduce including any special configuration, proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible) and the potential impact.

## Response

[{{back to navigation}}](#table-of-contents)

A security vulnerability will be responded to as soon as the gliff.ai team can. If for some reason a response has not been given within 3 days, please follow up to ensure the team has triaged the original issue correctly.

The gliff.ai team will then aim to release a fix/patch as soon as possible depending on the level of complexity and troubleshooting required.
